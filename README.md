## Overview

TrialCompass takes a free-text patient description — cancer type, biomarkers, prior treatments, performance status — and returns a ranked, explained list of matching clinical trials from a 10,000-trial ClinicalTrials.gov corpus. Keyword search fails for this problem because eligibility criteria are written in clinical shorthand: "EGFR exon 19 deletion, treatment-naive, ECOG ≤1" does not surface from a query like "lung cancer trial." The agentic approach solves this by decomposing the task — a parser agent structures the free text into a validated schema, a retrieval agent does semantic search and cross-encoder reranking over FAISS-indexed trial documents, and an explanation agent runs chain-of-thought eligibility reasoning per trial with SELF-RAG confidence flags and provenance citations. The result is a pipeline that produces ranked verdicts with reasoning, not a bag of keyword hits.

```

The four nodes are wired as a linear LangGraph state machine. Errors propagate through a state field — no conditional edges, no silent swallowing. Each node is a thin wrapper around its agent module so the graph stays decoupled from inference logic.

## Evaluation

Embedding model: `neuml/pubmedbert-base-embeddings`. Corpus: 64,920 oncology trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Eval set: 10-query oncology benchmark with 14 labeled NCT IDs, all manually verified against actual ClinicalTrials.gov eligibility criteria text before use as labels. Eval script: `src/evaluation/eval_three_configs.py`.

| Configuration | P@5 | MRR | k | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A: PubMedBERT bi-encoder only | 0.000 | 0.000 | 50 | Baseline |
| B: + MS-MARCO cross-encoder rerank | 0.020 | 0.039 | 50 | CE signal degrades at k>100 on full corpus |
| C: Hybrid (structured filter + CE rerank) | 0.040 | 0.084 | 500 | Filter reduces corpus to ~6,900; k=500 on filtered pool = k=50 density on full corpus |

The structured pre-filter is not a speed optimization — it is a quality gate. At k=500 on the full 64,920-trial corpus, cross-encoder scores compress toward a narrow band and performance degrades (Config B P@5 drops to 0.000). At k=500 on the filtered ~6,900-trial sub-corpus, pool density is equivalent to k=50 on the full corpus, and the cross-encoder maintains discriminative signal. This interaction between corpus size, retrieval depth, and reranker quality is the central empirical finding of this project.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:pranavsai19/Trialcompass.git
cd Trialcompass

python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Pull the local LLM (requires Ollama installed and running)
ollama pull llama3

# Run the CLI pipeline
PYTHONPATH=. python src/orchestration/run_pipeline.py \
  --patient "58-year-old female, stage IV NSCLC, EGFR exon 19 deletion, ECOG 1, failed carboplatin+pemetrexed, metastatic"

# Launch the Streamlit UI
PYTHONPATH=. streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

Ollama must be running (`ollama serve`) before any inference call. The FAISS index and SQLite database are in `data/` — no rebuild step needed for the 10K-trial corpus.

## Known Limitations

- **Eligibility text truncation at 2,000 characters.** The LLM only sees the first ~500 tokens of each trial's eligibility criteria. Disqualifying criteria buried in the second half of the document are invisible to the explanation agent. This is the primary driver of the 40% hallucination rate.
- **ms-marco cross-encoder domain mismatch.** The cross-encoder was trained on web retrieval pairs, not clinical text. It degrades P@5 from 0.080 to 0.060 on this eval set. A biomedical cross-encoder fine-tuned on clinical trial text is the planned replacement.
- **llama3 confidence is not calibrated.** The model reports HIGH confidence on approximately every verdict, including wrong ones. The SELF-RAG human-review flag is driven by uncertainty phrases in the reasoning text and eligibility text length — the confidence field itself should be ignored.
